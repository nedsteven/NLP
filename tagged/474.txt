<paragraph><sentence>The Connection Machine Model CM-5 Supercomputer is a massively
parallel computer system designed to offer performance in the range of
1 teraflops ($10^{12}$ floating-point operations per second)</sentence>. <sentence>The
CM-5 obtains its high performance while offering ease of programming,
flexibility, and reliability</sentence>. <sentence>The machine contains three
communication networks: a data network, a control network, and a
diagnostic network</sentence>. <sentence>This talk will describe the organization of these
three networks and how they contribute to the design goals of the
CM-5</sentence>.</paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>This work was done jointly with Zahi S. Abuhamdeh, David C.  Douglas,
Carl R. Feynman, Mahesh N. Ganmukhi, Jeffrey V. Hill, W. Daniel
Hillis, Bradley C. Kuszmaul, Margaret A. St.~Pierre, David S. Wells,
Monica C. Wong, Shaw-Wen Yang, Robert Zak, and about 500 others</sentence>.</paragraph>
