RI SEMINAR  CORRECTION
 WHEN:	FRIDAY, SEPT.4, 1992; <stime>3:30</stime> - <etime>5:00 PM</etime>
<paragraph><sentence>REFRESHMENTS WILL BE SERVED BY <stime>3:15 PM</stime></sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>The most difficult problem to develop an autonomous biped robot is
the programming of the biped walking gaits, especially when the
robot needs to negotiate different terrain</sentence>. <sentence>A Neural Gait</sentence></paragraph>

<paragraph><sentence>Synthesis mechanism is proposed to solve this problem</sentence>. <sentence>The</sentence></paragraph>

mechanism is implemented by using a gait synthesizer.  The gait
synthesizer consists of a number of functional units including a
Central Pattern Generator, an Adaptive Unit, a  Learning Unit and
a Knowledge Base. The Central Pattern Generator is responsible for
generating voluntary motion of the biped; the Adaptive Unit is
used to modify the motion patterns generated by the Central
<paragraph><sentence>Pattern Generator for negotiating a new terrain; the function of</sentence></paragraph>

the Learning Unit is to extract pattern features from newly
learned walking gaits; and the Knowledge Base stores the pattern
features along with terrain conditions.
<paragraph><sentence>Most of the recent efforts have been on the Adaptive Unit.Two</sentence></paragraph>

neural networks have been developed to implement the Adaptive
Unit.The first network consists of twenty reciprocally inhibited
and excited neurons and is trained by a reinforcement learning
rule.   Two learning algorithms are introduced.  The primary
concern of the first algorithm is the speed of gait modification,
whereas the second algorithm provides a solution with minimum
energy consumption.  The second neural network consists of an
inverse and a feed forward models, and both are multi-layer
perceptrons.  The network is trained by using a distal learning
rule.  It is shown that the network generates an adequate gait
pattern even with no direct teacher involved in the training.
<paragraph> Finally, simulation and experimental results will be presented.</paragraph>
