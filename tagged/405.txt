<paragraph>  Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in the theoretical</paragraph>

 aspects of real-time programming.  This has been fueled by the high
 costs associated with the failure of real-time systems.  This talk
 presents an extension of the testing paradigm of De Nicola and
<paragraph> Hennessy for concurrent processes to reasoning about reactive</paragraph>

 real-time processes.  We generate testing preorders that relate
 processes on the basis of their timing behavior as well as their
 degree of relative nondeterminism.  The framework is then applied
 to two different scenarios.  In the first, relations are constructed
 that relate processes on the basis of all timing considerations.  In
 the second, relations are constructed that relate processes on the
 basis of their relative speeds.  We then isolate a realistic class
 of reactive systems that can be compared on the basis of their
 relative speeds.  An algebra is then developed for such processes,
 and examples are given to illustrate the utility of the approach.
