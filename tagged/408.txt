Abstract:
 

		The TERA Computer System
	             Burton J. Smith
 		       Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center
                         Mellon Institute Bldg.
		Third Floor Conference Room             
			Oct 11, <stime>4:00 p.m</stime>.
(If you don't know where this room is, meet at <stime>3:45 p.m</stime>. at the 5th floor 
entrance and we can walk over together.)
<paragraph>          The TERA Computer System is a scalable shared memory MIMD computer.</paragraph>

<paragraph>  Although it has no vector instructions, the 256 processor version</paragraph>

  will have peak performance of about 300 GFLOPS.  The arithmetic
  will conform to IEEE standard 754.  The system's I/O cache, used 
  with disk arrays, will enable file system bandwidths of 70
  gigabytes per second or more.  The languages available will be
<paragraph>  Fortran 77, C and C++, and the programming environment will support</paragraph>

  a mixture of explicit programmer-generated and aggressive compiler-
  generated parallelism.  Tools will be provided to help users 
  re-engineer programs for parallel execution and to debug optimized,
  parallelized code.  A 16-processor system will be available for
  customer benchmarking in first quarter 1991.  First system 
  deliveries are scheduled for fourth quarter 1993.
<paragraph>	  The talk will describe the overall architecture of the system and</paragraph>

  its hardware implementation; the programming environment and
  associated tools; the operating system, including the file system;
  and the company's status and long-range plans.

Burton Smith is the president of Tera Inc.   Previously, he was the chief
architect of the HEP computer, a "barrel processor" introduced in the mid
80's.
