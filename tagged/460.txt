<paragraph>	There are many examples in the literature of mathematical </paragraph>

logic concerning the interpretation of one logical system 
in another. From a perspective informed by the 
formulae-as-types correspondence, it is natural to 
investigate logical interpretations from a computational 
point of view.     Of particular interest are logical 
interpretations that can be associated with simulations 
of one computational system in another. 
<paragraph>	The talk surveys several results of this kind, including </paragraph>

interpretations of classical logic in constructive logic 
that can be associated with ``continuation passing style'' 
transformations. These transformations simulate a functional 
language extended with control operators in a purely 
functional language. 	
<paragraph> NOTE: <speaker>Tim Griffin</speaker> will be here Thursday afternoon and all day Friday 6 Dec.</paragraph>
