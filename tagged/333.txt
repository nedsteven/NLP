   RISC in a robotics context stands for Reduced Intricacy in Sensing and
  Control.  But it shares the same philosophy as RISC computer design.
<paragraph>  The idea is to replace complicated manipulation and sensing steps with</paragraph>

  combinations of simple ones.  Industrial robotics research has focussed
  on anthropomorphism in the hope that once robots become sufficiently
  human-like, they will be able to solve all the tasks that they are
  currently incapable of doing.  This approach is seductive and has led
  researchers further and further away from the real problems that
  hinder the proliferation of robots in manufacturing.  The enthusiasm
  for robotics in industry which reached a peak in the mid 80's has all
  but disappeared after a protracted lack of progress on these problems.
<paragraph>   As Whitney [1] and others have argued, even if robots with human-like</paragraph>

  dexterity and flexibility could be built, and they are clearly decades
  away, they will be completely impractical economically.  The problem
  is that robots, at least in an industrial setting, need more dexterity
  and sensing capability than they have today, but far less than a human
  being.  We are trying a RISC approach to achieving this capability.  We
  achieve complicated manipulation and sensing performance by using
  *just enough* simple elements, namely:
	 * Dextrous manipulation is replaced by two or three
   transfer/grasping steps with simple, specialized grippers.
	 * Dense sensor input like vision or tactile or rangefinder 
   data is replaced by very low resolution sensors, like finger gap,
   optical beam or low-resolution tactile.
<paragraph>   This lets us build fast, cheap, simple, robust systems now rather than</paragraph>

  later.  The sensors are small and inexpensive enough that they can be
  placed throughout the environment, including on every gripper, so that
  each operation can be monitored throughout a task.
<paragraph>   This talk will give an overview of the approach, and some of the new</paragraph>

  research problems that it suggests.  Then we will describe some recent
  results on beam sensing.  In particular, we find that processing beam
  data provides object recognition times in milliseconds rather than
  minutes, and much finer localization than is possible with vision.  If
  a sensor provides few accurate values (rather than an enormous number
  of inaccurate ones as with vision), recognition reduces to a hash
  table lookup.
