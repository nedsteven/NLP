Topic 1: Object Segmentation Techniques for use in Visual Automation
<paragraph>    In designing automated systems for interpretation or manipulation of</paragraph>

   laboratory image data such as that derived from microphotographs, it is
   often the goal to perform operations that extract information about the
   structure of objects, and to separate and discern various objects within
   the data. Given a transformation of the pixel based image data into an
   explicit symbolic representation of the objects (i.e., the creation of
   objects of interest or Tokens), desired information can be extracted and
   characterized from the visual data. Simple segmentation schemes often lack
   the sophistication to deal with intricate or very subtle details of this
   image data. This paper will discuss advanced techniques useful in
   obtaining information relevant to the recognition and extraction of
   objects of interest in laboratory vision automation applications.
