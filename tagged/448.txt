<paragraph>    The  speaker will describe his rather unexpected experiences as a</paragraph>

    mere technologist in the corridors of  power  in  Washington.  By
    being  in  the  right place at the right time, he was selected as
    co-chair of the White House Information  Technology  Task  Force,
    which   was   tasked   during  the  early  days  of  the  Clinton
<paragraph>    Administration  to  recommend  a  new  computer  system  for  the</paragraph>

    Executive  Office  of  the  President.    His experiences include
    bringing  the  Internet  to  the  White  House  and  establishing
    Internet   accounts   for   the   President  and  Vice  President
    (president,vice.president@whitehouse.gov), participating  on  the
<paragraph>    Vice  President's  National  Performance  Review  to  re-engineer</paragraph>

    government through information technology, almost  knocking  over
    the President with a laserprinter, and inspecting the fiber optic
    network on board Air Force One.
